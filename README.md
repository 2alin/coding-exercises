### To Do
- [ ] Add more challenges
- [ ] Add more test cases for each challenge

### Description
This is a work in progress. The idea was brought up on April 26, so please wait kindly before trying this project.

Born first as only a repo to store my solutions to some of my favorites coding challenges. Now it's intended to be a platform that:
* Indexes all the challenges added in certain directory
* Shows my solution code in independent routes to each challenge
* Lists all the test cases as well as the response for each case
* Allows the user to type new test cases and test them.
