## Arrays: Left Rotation

A left rotation operation on an array shifts each of the array's elements 1 unit to the left. For example, if 2 left rotations are performed on array `[1,2,3,4,5]`, then the array would become `[3,4,5,1,2]`

Given an array `a` of `n` integers and a number, `d`, perform `d` left rotations on the array. Return the updated array to be printed as a single line of space-separated integers.

**Input Format**

- `a` : arrray of `n` positive integers
- `d` : positive integer

**Output Format**

- array of `n` positive integers

**Sample Input**

```
a = [1,2,3,4,5]
d = 4
```

**Sample Output**

```
[5,1,2,3,4]
```
